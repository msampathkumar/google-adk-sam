    "#### Overview: From Conversations to Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1, we transformed stateless LLMs into conversational agents using **Sessions** - giving them the ability to remember within a single conversation. But there's a limitation: when you start a new session, all those valuable insights about user preferences, learned patterns, and important context vanish like morning mist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** Imagine a personal assistant who forgets everything about you every time you start a new conversation. They wouldn't remember that you prefer concise answers, that you're learning Python, or that you mentioned being colorblind last week. This is the gap between conversation-level memory (Sessions) and true personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** In this notebook, we'll give our agents **long-term memory** - a persistent, searchable knowledge store that transcends individual conversations. Think of it as upgrading from sticky notes (Sessions) to a well-organized filing system (Memory) that your agent can reference across all interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- The fundamental difference between Sessions and Memory in agent architecture\n",
    "- How to implement persistent memory using ADK's Memory Services\n",
    "- Strategies for extracting and storing valuable information from conversations\n",
    "- Best practices for searching and utilizing stored memories\n",
    "- The relationship between working memory (Session State) and long-term memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time:** 10-20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, your agents will be able to learn from past interactions and provide truly personalized experiences that improve over time.\n",

    "## 5. Empowering Agents with Memory Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main architectural patterns for retrieving or loading memories into an agent's context within the Agent Development Kit (ADK): **Proactive Retrieval (Static Loading)** and **Reactive Retrieval (Memory-as-a-Tool)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proactive Retrieval** ensures context is always available by automatically loading memories at the beginning of every conversation turn. This uses the `PreloadMemoryTool` built into ADK. Although this pattern guarantees the context is present, it can introduce **unnecessary latency for turns that do not require memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reactive Retrieval**, often referred to as `Memory-as-a-Tool`, grants the agent the autonomy to decide when memory access is necessary. This is implemented using the LoadMemoryTool, which the agent invokes when its reasoning determines that past context is needed to answer a query. This approach is generally more efficient as the latency and cost of retrieval are incurred only when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to build custom implementations for Proactive and Reactive retrievals:\n",
    "• Proactive Retrieval can be implemented via a `custom callback` to manually retrieve memories and append them to the system instructions.\n",
    "• Reactive Retrieval can be implemented via a `custom tool` where the developer defines what type of information might be available, enabling a more informed decision by the LLM on when to query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the simplified representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Description | Implementation Options |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Proactive Retrieval (Static Loading) | Memory is loaded before the agent's main processing loop begins. It's **always on** and available. | 1. PreloadMemoryTool |\n",
    "|  |  | 2. Custom callback (on_before_agent_call) |\n",
    "| Reactive Retrieval (Memory-as-a-Tool) | Memory is treated as a separate tool that the **agent can choose** to call during its execution, when needed. | 1. LoadMemoryTool |\n",
    "|  |  | 2. Custom Tool Implementation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1. The Problem: Agent Can't Access Memory Yet\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've stored memories, but our agent doesn't know how to use them. It's like having a filing cabinet full of valuable information but no way to access it. Let's fix that by giving our agent the `load_memory` tool.\n",

    "## 6. What You've Built\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully transformed a stateless LLM into an intelligent agent with persistent memory that spans across conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Journey Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understood the Challenge**: Recognized how Sessions provide only temporary memory within a single conversation\n",
    "2. **Implemented Memory Storage**: Used `InMemoryMemoryService` to create a searchable knowledge base\n",
    "3. **Transferred Knowledge**: Learned how to extract valuable information from sessions and store it as memories\n",
    "4. **Enabled Memory Access**: Equipped your agent with the `load_memory` tool to access past conversations\n",
    "5. **Achieved Persistence**: Created an agent that remembers user preferences across different sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sessions vs Memory**: Sessions handle conversation flow; Memory provides long-term knowledge\n",
    "- **Memory is Searchable**: Unlike sessions, memories can be queried semantically\n",
    "- **Tools Enable Access**: The `load_memory` tool bridges the gap between stored memories and agent capabilities\n",
    "- **User-Specific**: Memories are segregated by user, ensuring privacy and personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In production environments, you'll want to:\n",
    "- Use **Vertex AI Memory Bank** for scalable, persistent memory storage\n",
    "- Implement memory curation strategies to extract the most valuable insights\n",
    "- Add memory expiration policies for data governance\n",
    "- Consider using artifacts for storing structured data and files\n",
    "\n",
    "Your agents can now build relationships with users over time, learning preferences and providing increasingly personalized experiences. This is the foundation of truly intelligent conversational AI!"
